# /dev
It is a very interesting directory that highlights one important aspect of the Linux filesystem - everything is a file or a directory

The majority of devices are either block or character devices.

In general, 'block devices' are devices that store or hold data, 'character devices' can be thought of as devices that transmit or transfer data.

# 通用文件

Some common device files as well as their equivalent counterparts under Windows that you may wish to remember are:

- /dev/ttyS0 (First communications port, COM1) 

First serial port (mice, modems).

- /dev/psaux (PS/2) 

PS/2 mouse connection (mice, keyboards).

- /dev/lp0 (First printer port, LPT1) 

First parallel port (printers, scanners, etc).

- /dev/dsp (First audio device)
 
The name DSP comes from the term digital signal processor, 
a specialized processor chip optimized for digital signal analysis. 
Sound cards may use a dedicated DSP chip, or may implement the functions with a number of discrete devices. 
Other terms that may be used for this device are digitized voice and PCM.

- /dev/usb (USB Devices)
